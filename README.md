Chess Project

Description:
The Chess project is aimed at implementing the game of chess from scratch, 
followed by the development of a model to mimic specific players based on their game history. 
The project involves creating a chess engine, downloading game histories of targeted players, 
preprocessing the data, building a model architecture, and training the model. 
Future plans include exploring transfer learning on the Maia model.

Features:
- Chess engine implementation from scratch
- Player mimic model based on game history
- Transfer learning on the Maia model (future plan)
